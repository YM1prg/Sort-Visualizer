# 🧠 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A tool to visually demonstrate how sorting algorithms work, with interactive controls, animations, and performance insights.

## 🎯 Overview

This project provides a visual and interactive way to learn about sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort). Users can select an algorithm, adjust input size and animation speed, and watch step-by-step animations while comparing performance metrics.

## 🔧 Features

### ✅ User Capabilities
- Choose from multiple sorting algorithms.
- Adjust dataset size and animation speed.
- Watch real-time step-by-step sorting animations.
- Compare the performance of different algorithms.

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture

### Backend
- Generates datasets (random or user-defined).
- Executes sorting algorithms and tracks each step.
- Communicates with frontend via API or stream interface.

### Frontend
- Displays animated visuals (e.g., colored bars representing array elements).
- Provides UI controls for:
  - Algorithm selection
  - Animation speed
  - Dataset size
- Updates visuals in real-time based on backend data.

### Communication
- Frontend sends configuration parameters (algorithm, dataset size, speed) to backend.
- Backend streams sorting steps back to frontend for animation rendering.

## 🧱 Key Features

- **Multiple Algorithms Supported**: Includes Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- **Customizable Input**: Adjustable dataset size and random/user-defined inputs.
- **Visual Feedback**: Highlights active elements during comparisons and swaps.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays time complexity and actual execution times.

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### Backend
- Built using a lightweight framework (e.g., Flask/FastAPI for Python or Express.js for Node.js).
- Implements sorting algorithms iteratively to log and stream each step.

### Frontend
- Uses modern web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (or frameworks like React/Vue).
- Renders dynamic visuals using SVG or Canvas.
- Animates transitions between sorting states using CSS or JS timing functions.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Expand to visualize other algorithm types (e.g., pathfinding, searching).
- Add user accounts for saving preferences and settings.
- Implement multi-algorithm comparison mode.
- Allow exporting animations as GIFs or videos.
